Nietzsche's writing spans philosophical polemics, poetry, 
cultural criticism, and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony. 
Prominent elements of his philosophy include his radical critique of truth 
in favor of perspectivism; a genealogical critique of religion and Christian morality 
and a related theory of masterâ€“slave morality; 
the aesthetic affirmation of life in response to both the "death of God" 
and the profound crisis of nihilism; 
the notion of Apollonian and Dionysian forces; 
and a characterization of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, 
collectively understood as the will to power.
