Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher.
From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, 
"natural philosophy" encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physics. 
For example, Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy 
later became classified as a book of physics. 
In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities 
led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. 
Since then, various areas of investigation that were traditionally part of philosophy 
have become separate academic disciplines, 
and namely the social sciences such as psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics.
