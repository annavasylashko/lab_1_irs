Aristotle's views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. 
The influence of physical science extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, 
and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories 
such as classical mechanics were developed. 
Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in his biology, 
such as on the hectocotyl arm of the octopus, 
were disbelieved until the 19th century. 
He also influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophy during the Middle Ages, 
as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism 
of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. 
Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as "The First Teacher", 
and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas as simply "The Philosopher",
while the poet Dante called him "the master of those who know". 
His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, 
and were studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and John Buridan.
